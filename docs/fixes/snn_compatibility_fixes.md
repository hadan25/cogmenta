# SNN Compatibility Fixes

## Issue: Missing `concept_mappings` attribute in EnhancedSpikingCore

### Problem
During training and evaluation of the symbolic reasoning system, we encountered an `AttributeError` related to accessing the `concept_mappings` attribute on the `EnhancedSpikingCore` object. This was causing the following error:

```
[Bridge] Symbolic processing error: 'EnhancedSpikingCore' object has no attribute 'concept_mappings'
```

This error was occurring in the `EnhancedNeuroSymbolicBridge` when it was trying to access the SNN's `concept_mappings` attribute, which wasn't being properly initialized in all cases.

### Solution

We made the following changes to address this issue:

1. Added a new helper method `_check_snn_compatibility` to the `EnhancedNeuroSymbolicBridge` class that:
   - Checks if the SNN has the required `concept_mappings` attribute
   - Adds a stub empty dictionary if the attribute is missing
   - Returns the modified SNN

2. Modified the `__init__` method to call this helper method after initializing the SNN:
   ```python
   self.snn = self._check_snn_compatibility(self.snn)
   ```

3. Enhanced the `process_text_and_reason` method to:
   - Wrap the SNN processing in a try-except block to catch AttributeError exceptions
   - Create a minimal fallback result if an error occurs
   - Re-check SNN compatibility when errors are detected
   - Reduce neural activity levels when falling back to simpler processing

### Benefits

These changes provide the following benefits:

1. **Graceful Degradation**: The system now degrades gracefully when it encounters compatibility issues with the SNN, rather than crashing.

2. **Self-Healing**: The system attempts to fix compatibility issues by adding missing attributes, allowing processing to continue.

3. **Error Feedback**: Errors are properly logged and communicated, making it easier to diagnose issues.

4. **Continued Processing**: Even when SNN processing fails, the symbolic reasoning components can still function, enabling the system to provide partial results.

### Future Improvements

For more robust SNN integration, consider the following improvements:

1. Ensure consistent initialization of `concept_mappings` in the `EnhancedSpikingCore` class itself, rather than relying on this compatibility layer.

2. Add a formal interface or abstract base class that defines the required attributes and methods for SNN components to implement.

3. Create a more comprehensive compatibility checking system that can handle a wider range of potential missing attributes or methods.

4. Consider adding unit tests specifically for verifying SNN compatibility with the bridge.
