# ProofWriter Integration Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the ProofWriter dataset integration and symbolic reasoning components in the Cogmenta Core system.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dataset Loading Fix

- Modified the dataset loading code to use local ProofWriter files instead of attempting to download from HuggingFace
- Updated the code to correctly parse the JSON format of the existing synthetic dataset files
- Added verification to ensure dataset files exist and can be loaded before training begins

### 2. Triple Extraction Improvements

- Enhanced the triple extraction logic to handle complex sentences like "If all birds can fly and penguins are birds, can penguins fly?"
- Added support for recognizing "all X are Y" patterns
- Improved handling of "X can Y" ability statements
- Added better decomposition of compound statements with "and" conjunctions
- Added question parsing to extract "can X Y?" and "is X a Y?" questions

### 3. Training Protocol Enhancements

- Increased the default number of epochs from 5 to 10 for better learning
- Removed the arbitrary example limit to use the full available dataset
- Implemented curriculum learning by starting with simpler examples and gradually introducing more complex ones
- Added more logging and checkpointing throughout the training process

### 4. Component Integration Improvements

- Enhanced knowledge transfer between components in the subsystem integration
- Added bidirectional information flow between Prolog and Vector Symbolic Architecture
- Improved the symbolic grounding mechanism to connect symbolic and neural representations
- Added proper integration metrics calculation via the Phi measure

## New Features

### Verification Script

Created a new `run_reasoning_training.py` script that:
- Verifies the dataset availability and format
- Tests the triple extraction on complex examples
- Provides command-line options for output directory and epoch count
- Implements more thorough logging and error handling

### Phi Calculation

Added the `_calculate_phi` method to measure system integration using an information-theoretic approach, which:
- Computes mutual information between subsystems
- Scales to a normalized value between 0 and 1
- Helps track the integration level during training

## Usage

To run the improved reasoning training:

```bash
python training/run_reasoning_training.py --output_dir training_output/reasoning --epochs 10
```

For verification without training:

```bash
python training/run_reasoning_training.py --verify_only
```

## Next Steps

1. Further enhance the triple extraction to handle more complex sentence structures
2. Implement deeper integration with the neural components
3. Expand the reasoning capabilities to handle more complex inference chains
4. Improve the evaluation metrics to better capture reasoning quality
