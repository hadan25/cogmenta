## ConceptNet Training Module

The ConceptNet training module has been completed and provides the following capabilities:

- Downloads and processes ConceptNet data from the official source
- Integrates conceptual knowledge into both symbolic and vector representations
- Training for symbol grounding, relation extraction, knowledge abstraction, and integration
- Evaluation of system performance on conceptual tasks
- Visualization of training results and concept relationships

### Getting Started with ConceptNet Training

To set up the ConceptNet training environment:

```bash
# Windows
setup_conceptnet_training.bat

# Linux/macOS
python -m training.run_concept_training --sample_data
```

See `training/README_CONCEPTNET.md` for detailed documentation on using the ConceptNet training module.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Symbolic Reasoning**: Accuracy, inference steps, explanation quality
