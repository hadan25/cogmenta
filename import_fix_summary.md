# Import Error Fix Summary

The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cogmenta'` was fixed by making the following changes:

1. **Installed the project in development mode**:
   ```
   pip install -e .
   ```
   This ensures that the Python package is correctly installed and the modules can be imported properly.

2. **Fixed the import path in `training/training_plan.py`**:
   Changed `from cogmenta.prolog.prolog_engine import PrologEngine` to `from models.symbolic.prolog_engine import PrologEngine`

3. **Added placeholder implementations**:
   - Created a basic implementation of `NeuroSymbolicBridge` in `processing/__init__.py`
   - Created a basic implementation of `ThoughtTrace` in `visualization/__init__.py`

4. **Fixed trainer initialization**:
   Modified the `_initialize_trainers` method in `training/training_plan.py` to initialize the trainers with the correct parameters.

## Remaining Issues

The training script now runs but encounters some runtime errors:

1. `'ConceptNetTrainer' object has no attribute 'train'` - The ConceptNetTrainer might be using `run_full_training` instead of `train`
2. `name 'random' is not defined` - The AtomicTrainer needs to import the random module

## Next Steps

1. Fix the remaining runtime errors in the trainers
2. Review the implementation of the cognitive architecture components
3. Ensure all required dependencies are installed
4. Consider refactoring the code to have a more consistent module structure
